# To-Do List App
I designed and developed a simple To-Do List app based on user research with my School of Code colleagues. The app helps create a learning plan with a clean, intuitive interface, allowing users to easily add, delete, and manage tasks.
## Features

- Add new tasks to the to-do list
- Delete tasks when they are completed
- Simple and intuitive user interface

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Irenalou3/ToDo-List.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd to-do-list
    ```

3. Open `index.html` in your browser to view and use the app:
    ```bash

    ```
