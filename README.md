# To-Do List App
As somone who always has a busy day, I decided to create a easy to use ToDo List application for myself and others. My main aim was to make it as user friendly as possible, I undertook user researc with my elderly parents to recieve feedback from them wether they could use it with ease, And for people who can barely work the teleision.
